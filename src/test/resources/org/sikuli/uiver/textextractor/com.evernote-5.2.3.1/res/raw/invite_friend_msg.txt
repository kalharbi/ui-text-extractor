Hi there!

I've been using Evernote and I think it's great.

It lets me capture all of my experiences, thoughts, and memories, and easily find them anytime.

Give it a try.

=========================================================

Evernote helps you remember everything. 

You can take notes, jot to-do lists, snap photos, save web pages, and
have it all accessible and searchable at any time from your
computer (Windows and Mac), the Web, iPhone/iPad/iPod,
Android, BlackBerry and other mobile devices.

Evernote can even find printing or handwritten text within photos.

Create your new Evernote account by clicking on the link below or pasting it into the browser's address bar:

Enjoy,
